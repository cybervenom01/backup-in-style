The bash script will help you backup and encrypt your data
on a local or remote storage.

What does the script do?
	* backup data
	* restore data
	* transfer that data to another device
	* encrypt the data
	* decrypt the data
	* compress the data
	* decompress the data

What commands are used to backup your data?
	* tar
	* cpio
	* dump**
	* find
	* xargs
	* gzip
	* bzip2
	* gpg
	* scp
	* ssh
	* hash check sums commands

New features I want to add:
	* incremental backups
	* full backups
	* check to see if the commands exist
	* if they don't exist ask to download them
	* check if the commands are really needed
	  to perform the backups
