# backup-in-style

This is a script that lets you create a data backup of a file or data that is in the hard drive that
you consider important. Those files that you have chosen will then be compressed into a ".tar.gz"
archive. When compression is finished, it will ask you where you want to transfer your data. After making
your choice, your backup will be transfered to a secondary storage location like a USB drive, an
external HD, or a remote server like an SSH (Secure Shell) Server. The later is the preferred way
to transfer your backup to a secure server while in a insecure network.

The backup created can help you protect your important data from accidental deletion or data
corruption. Disasters can happen at any given moment in time for example, a power outage, your
computer gets infected by a computer virus, or you accidentally hit the "Exit without Saving" button on
the screen for your word document program.

The script is interactive and requires input from the user. It displays a user friendly messages to
help you with the information you need to enter at the prompt. The script is moderately commented to help
you understand what the script is doing.
