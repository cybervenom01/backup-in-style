deletion or data corruption. Disasters can happen at any given moment
in time. For example, you could be working on your computer when an
unexpected a power outage happens. Your computer gets infected by a
computer virus, or you can accidentaly hit the "Exit Without Saving"
button on the screen for your word document.

This script is interactive and requires user input. It displays
user friendly messages to help you with the information you need to
enter at the prompt. It is moderately commented to help you understand
what the script is doing.

Executing this script will help you backup your important data
of your choice. The data you have chosen to backup will be compressed
into a "tar.gz" archive. Then you will have the choice to transfer your
backup data to a secure location.
